# Estimating Treatment Effect Using Machine Learning

We will be using different methods to evaluate the results of a randomized control trial (RCT).

We will learn:

1. How to analyze data from a randomized control trial using both:
a. traditional statistical methods
b. and the more recent machine learning techniques
2. Interpreting Multivariate Models
a. Quantifying treatment effect
b. Calculating baseline risk
c. Calculating predicted risk reduction
3. Evaluating Treatment Effect Models
a. Comparing predicted and empirical risk reductions
b. Computing C-statistic-for-benefit
4. Interpreting ML models for Treatment Effect Estimation
a. Implement T-learner
