# Estimating Treatment Effect Using Machine Learning

We will be using different methods to evaluate the results of a randomized control trial (RCT).

We will learn:

1. How to analyze data from a randomized control trial using traditional statistical methods and the more recent machine learning techniques
2. Interpreting Multivariate Models by Quantifying treatment effect, Calculating baseline risk, and Calculating predicted risk reduction
3. Evaluating Treatment Effect Models by comparing predicted and empirical risk reductions and computing C-statistic-for-benefit
4. Interpreting ML models for Treatment Effect Estimation by implementing T-learner
